# django-to-azure2
Deploy Django app to Azure

This is my first ever programming project! I have built a blogsite using Python with the Django Framework. My initial plan was to host the entire site (assets and static files) on Azure but faced some challenges. I am currently hosting my assets on Azure Blob Storage, but my static files are hosted on Heroku.
